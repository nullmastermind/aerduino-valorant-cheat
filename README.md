Changelog:
- Added the support for 4 different mouse libraries, so choose and load on Arduino which you prefer (ANIMALI, DOGE, DOGESIMPLE, HIDMOUSEREPORT), and write it in MouseType in the Config.ini file
- Mouse libraries updated and included in the release, so please download them again
- Fixed keyboard lag problem
- Fixed the problem for which aim assistant did not work without pressing right mouse button
- Performance Boost parameter added to decrease cpu usage
- High CPU usage parameter added to increase performances while a1mb0tting
- Added the possibility to use flick while not aiming and aim assistant while aiming, and in general to enable aim assistan only while aiming (please remember that in flick and aim assistan will not work together if this option is disabled
- Added the possibility to insert HSV color ranges instead of predefined ones, to test it without closing cheeto. You can use it to find/test yellow/red color ranges or improve purple. If you find them, please share them with me ðŸ™‚
- Silent still not works, because I think it's less important, I will fx it in future

Please read Config.ini file for more details
